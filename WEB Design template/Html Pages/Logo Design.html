      <h1>Job description</h1>
      <p>
        Logo designers create graphical and typographical symbols that represent a company or product in
        presentations and on websites and packaging. During the course of design development, a graphic artist
        confers with clients to discuss concepts, prepare initial sketches of ideas and layout the logo
        design, often using computer illustration software. Logo designers might work with researchers who
        study a target audience, as well as with advertising specialists to effectively produce a logo that
        achieves brand recognition.
      </p>
      <h1>Who Is Logo Designer ?</h1>
      <p>
        Logo designers are professional graphic designers who create unique and custom brand imagery for the
        individual or company who hired them. Logo designers can either be freelancers, full-time employees at
        a design firm or advertising agency, or work under a temporary contract. Most professional designers
        have an undergraduate degree in graphic design and may also have experience in marketing and
        advertising.
